+ .color-primary-1 { color: #A0F569 }
+ .color-primary-2 { color: #84F23C }
+ .color-primary-3 { color: #5CEA00 }
+ .color-primary-4 { color: #49BA00 }

+ .color-complement-0 { color: #39B9CB }

+ .color-complement-2 { color: #259CAD }
+ .color-complement-3 { color: #53CFE0 }
+ .color-complement-4 { color: #73E0EF }

### PEERS STATEMENT - 
 + Adam : i quite like design 1 as that to me suits the vibe of the website more then design 2

### FINAL DECISION
 My final decision is using Design 1 because as I said it fits with my logo that I created, with colour text (Colour Text is going be *black*), and I will use #53CFE0 for my main & other pages as a BACKGROUND, for boxes I will use #259CAD, inside the boxes there's going be another boxe(s) I will use **GREY** colour, for bottom & top I will use #5CEA00 and very bottom one where's going be a copyright name I will use **DARK GREY** colour.
